<h1>Not Allowed To Regulate</h1>

      <img src="img/TODO.gif">
      <p>However, the perspective of banning moderation is not held by very many because of its many many flaws.</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <p> - No way to prevent spam bots <br> - No way to curb misinformation<br> - No way to prevent constant hateful trolling<br> - etc</p>
      <p>Furthermore, these issues dont really go away with time. Spamming and trolling all pollute conversations that they are part of and spamming and misinformation are far easier than careful consideration and accuracy. Thus these negatives are always able to overcome.</p>
      <p>Platforms simply can not exist without some regulation.</p>
      <p>There exist platforms with very minimal moderation - anonymous image boards like 4 chan - and all the people that I have talked to online that have spent substantive time on these platforms regret it.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, it is not something for everyone, and a law that mandates lack of moderation would be obviously foolish.</p>
