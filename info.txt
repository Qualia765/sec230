~Intro
There is a fundamental balance between the activities individuals naturally have the right to do and those which are deemed bad.
For example sautéing with a frying pan is perfectly acceptable.

Meanwhile, hitting someone on the head with the very same frying pan is not.

The lines are drawn in the social contracts that we call laws.
We have laws that dictate that harming others is illegal.

We also have laws that dictate that those who break the laws should be punished.

As long as laws are mutually beneficial, enforced, and justly applied...
!think.gif
It is in everyone's best interest to follow them.

The 3 branches of the US government exist to carry out these three duties.
As US citizens it is our responsibility to elect those who will ensure our government does these well.
(Or, at least know of and have opinions about the laws that we are bound to.)

~What is Section 230
Part of one of these laws is Section 230.
Section 230 is a very important provision within the United States Communications Act.
I will be discuss why it is so important.

Lets imagine that <span style="color:#006669;">Cyan</span> hit <span style="color:#623381;">Purple</span> with the frying pan.

Should the frying pan retailer be held liable for <span style="color:#006669;">Cyan</span>'s actions?
In this case obviously not - they did not expect nor intend <span style="color:#006669;">Cyan</span> to use it harm <span style="color:#623381;">Purple</span> with it.

But what if the technology was a machine gun - designed exclusively for harming people.
Many people no longer believe it to be acceptable.

Section 230 addresses this discussion for the internet.
Most interaction on the internet is through means of a centralized platform.
!computer.gif
These platforms facilitate spreading information, sharing images, and shopping between users.
Similar to sautéing with the frying pan - these actions are perfectly acceptable.

But if the information is private [1], the images are compromising [3], or the listings are a scam [2], then it is not.

The question is where these platforms fall on the line from misused frying pan to machine used for intended purpose.
!platforms role.gif
This question is complicated by the fact the platforms sort, moderate, and even promote specific content - which might include these unacceptable media.
!platforms filter.gif
Section 230 says that the platform is never at fault - unless the issue is related to CSAM, sex trafficking or copyright. [4]
(Copyright is instead handled by DMCA - which is a even larger can of worms which will not be discussed here) [5]

~Is Section 230 Good
But is Section 230 good?
I will now preform an analysis.
I will use my preferred ethical framework, utilitarianism with a subjective utility function.
Along the way I shall, as I already have, make use of social contracts to explain win win agreements, and virtue ethics as a heuristic for shortcut evaluation of the utility function.

We can consider this with a decision matrix.
We will consider different possible alternate version of the law and then analyze short-term and long-term impact.
!decision matrix template.png
Most complaints come from either from feeling that platforms are too restrict - so users should get more freedoms. Or that platforms get off too free and must be regulated more.
These perspectives can be placed on a spectrum where with Section 230 right in the middle.
!1axis.png
But we can see this actually 2d plane of options, where right now Section 230 is primarily focused on the rights of the platforms.
For my argument I will focus on the extremes of this diagram.
